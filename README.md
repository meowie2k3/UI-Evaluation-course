# Harmonix: Song name recognition application with the power of AI

This app is designed to recognize the user's song name that they are listening to in varius user flow. Moreover, this application can help improve other music service recommendation system by learning the user's music taste and elevate user experience on music relaxation process.


In this prototype, users should be able to perform various tasks related to song recognition and music recommendation. The application utilizes AI technology to identify the song name that the user is listening to and provides recommendations based on the user's music taste. This enhances the user experience in the music relaxation process and contributes to improving music service recommendation systems.
